# AI_agent_withRAG_and_searchAPI

üöÄ Built a Simple AI Agent System! ü§ñ

Imagine having a system where, if you ask any question:

It answers based on your enterprise data (like research papers, internal documents, etc.) provied your data.
OR, if it's a general question, it uses a search engine to fetch real-time information.
And the best part is LLM decides on its own which route to take‚Äîwhether to query your enterprise data or search the web for an answer! üß†

How I Achieved This üîß
To build this system, I combined:
1Ô∏è‚É£ LangGraph (from LangChain): For orchestrating the agent's workflow.
2Ô∏è‚É£ FAISS Vector DB: Loaded a research paper into FAISS for fast retrieval-based search.
3Ô∏è‚É£ DuckDuckGo Search: Integrated DuckDuckGo as a real-time search engine for general queries.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Groq AI‚Äôs Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile: Used this powerful LLM for decision-making and answering questions seamlessly.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Decision Flow: The agent dynamically switches between retrieval-based search (RAG) and web search based on the query.

How You Can Improve This üöÄ
This system can be enhanced further with:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Integration: Fetch answers from enterprise databases by connecting via APIs or secure keys.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Tools: Integrate APIs for platforms like Slack, Jira, or CRM tools to expand the agent‚Äôs knowledge base.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Decision Logic: Use more advanced LangChain Agents with fine-tuned prompts to control tool selection.
4Ô∏è‚É£ External Data Feeds: Add real-time APIs for live updates like stock prices, weather, or news.

This was a super exciting project where I got to blend retrieval-based reasoning and real-time web search with the power of Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile from Groq AI. The results? A flexible agent capable of tackling both internal enterprise data and general knowledge queries.
